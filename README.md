Feedolin is an RSS / Atom reader and podcast player. It is intended for users who already use an rss reader client and want to read their feeds on a KaiOS device. the list of subscribed websites / podcasts is managed locally or online in an opml.

**NEW**

Now it is also possible to load mastodon content, in the settings of the app you will find a login button with which you can log in with your mastodon account.

## Installation

You have to save the list of urls in a .opml file as in the example.
In the settings you can set where the app should get this file from.
It can be stored locally or online on a server.

if you want to show mastodon public timelines you have to set the type="mastodon" in the link list
For example:
`<outline type="mastodon" text="mastodon.social" title="mastodon.social" xmlUrl="https://mastodon.social/api/v1/timelines/public" htmlUrl=""/>`

## How to install

- KaiOs Store
- Sideloading <a href="https://www.martinkaptein.com/blog/sideloading-and-deploying-apps-to-kai-os/">step-by-step article</a> by martinkaptein

You can download the latest version from the Releases page.
The app is not auto-updating. To update it, you have to follow the same steps you took when installing it.

## Mastodon

Originally I only wanted to write an rss reader for KaiOS, now I have decided to connect the fediverse as well. a mastodon login enables you to display the mastodon home timeline. in mastodon you have the option of subscribing to other sources/instances of fediverse, which will then also find their way to your feature phone.
